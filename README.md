### Abstract

The presentation introduces a framework for anomaly detection using one-class support vector methods (SVDD / LS-SVDD) applied to neural network embedding layers. The approach is designed to detect distributional shifts and outliers in high-dimensional settings and is evaluated through simulation studies and real-world datasets.
